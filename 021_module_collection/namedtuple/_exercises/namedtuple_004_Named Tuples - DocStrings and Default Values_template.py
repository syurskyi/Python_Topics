# # Named Tuples - DocStrings and Default Values
#
# f.. c... ____ P.2.
#
# # Adding DocStrings to Named Tuples
# # This is easy to do, both with the generated class, as well as it's properties.
#
# Point2D _ P.2. 'P.2.' 'x y'
# P.2..__doc__ = 'Represents a 2D Cartesian coordinate'
#
# # And we can even add docstrings to the properties:
#
# P.2..x.__do___ 'x-coordinate'
# P.2..y.__do___ 'y-coordinate'
# he.. P.2.
