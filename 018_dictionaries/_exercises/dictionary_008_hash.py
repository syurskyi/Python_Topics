# # Dictionary keys must be hashable objects. Associated values on the other hand can be any object
# # So tuples of hashable objects are themselves hashable, but lists are not, even if they only contain hashable elements.
# # Tuples of non-hashable elements are also not hashable.
# #
# hash 1 2 3
# hash([1, 2, 3])
# hash(([1, 2], [3, 4]))
#
# # Interestingly, functions are hashable:
# ___ my_func a b c
#     print(a, b, c)
#
# # Which means we can use functions as keys in dictionaries:
# d _ |my_func 10 20 30|
#
