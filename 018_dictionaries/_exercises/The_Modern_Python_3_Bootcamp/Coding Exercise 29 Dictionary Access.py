# # Bakery Dictionary Exercise Solution
# #
# # REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO USE FORMAT() RATHER THAN F-STRINGS IN THE UDEMY CODE EDITOR!
# #
# # The following code is common to all solutions:
#
# # ____ ra.. ______ ch..  # DON'T CHANGE!
#
# food = ch.. (["cheese pizza", "quiche", "morning bun", "gummy bear", "tea cake"])  # DON'T CHANGE!
#
# # DON'T CHANGE THIS DICTIONARY EITHER!
# bakery_stock = {
#     "almond croissant": 12,
#     "toffee cookie": 3,
#     "morning bun": 1,
#     "chocolate chunk cookie": 9,
#     "tea cake": 25
# }
#
# # Solution using IN
# #
# # In the last video, we saw how to use in to test if a value is contained in a dictionary:
#
# __ food __ b..
#     print *@ left .f.. b.. ?
# ____
#     print("We don't make that")
#
# # Solution using get()
# #
# # We can do the same thing using get() and storing the result to a variable.
# # The variable will either contain the corresponding value from the dictionary OR None.
# # We can write a simple conditional check:
#
# quantity = b__.g.. ?
# __ ?
#     print *@ left .f.. ?
# ____
#     print("we don't make that")
#
