# # Version 1
# #
# # Loop over donations, add all the VALUES together and store in a variable called total_donations
#
# donations = dict(sam=25.0, lena=88.99, chuck=13.0, linus=99.5, stan=150.0, lisa=50.25, harrison=10.0)
#
# total_donations = 0
#
# ___ donation __ ?.v..
#     t.. += ?
#
# # Advanced Version 1 -
# #
# # This solution uses a built-in function called sum() which I cover in the "Lambdas and Built-In Functions" section.
# # We haven't talked about how it works, but if you're curious...
#
# total_donations = su. donation ___ ? __ ?.v..
#
# # Advanced Version 2
# #
# # An even better solution using the same sum built-in function is just this nice little line:
#
# total_donations = su. ?.v..
