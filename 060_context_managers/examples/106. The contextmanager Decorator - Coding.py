# Using Decorators to Create Context Managers using Generator Functions
# In the last video we saw how we could create a generic class that could take a generator function that
# had a specific structure and turn it into a context manager.
# Let's see if we can do one step better, using a decorator instead.
# Recall the basic structure our generator function needs to have:
# def gen(args):
#     # set up happens here, or inside try
#     try:
#         yield obj # whatever normally gets returned by __enter__
#     finally:
#         # perform clean up code here
# First let's define a generator function to open a file, yield it, and then close it - same as the example we saw
# in the previous video:


print('#' * 52 + '  ### Using Decorators to Create Context Managers using Generator Functions')


def open_file(fname, mode='r'):
    print('opening file...')
    f = open(fname, mode)
    try:
        yield f
    finally:
        print('closing file...')
        f.close()

# Next, let's re-create the context manager wrapper we did in the last video, but this time, I'm going to pass it a
# generator object, instead of a generator function. But basically the same idea:


class GenContextManager:
    def __init__(self, gen):
        self.gen = gen

    def __enter__(self):
        return next(self.gen)

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb):
        print('calling next to perform cleanup in generator')
        try:
            next(self.gen)
        except StopIteration:
            pass
        return False

# At this point we can use this with our generator function as follows:

file_gen = open_file('test.txt', 'w')

with GenContextManager(file_gen) as f:
    f.writelines('Sir Spamalot')
# opening file...
# calling next to perform cleanup in generator
# closing file...
# ######################################################################################################################

# And we can read back from the file too:
print('#' * 52 + '  And we can read back from the file too:')

file_gen = open_file('test.txt')
with GenContextManager(file_gen) as f:
    print(f.r..())
# opening file...
# ['Sir Spamalot']
# calling next to perform cleanup in generator
# closing file...
# ######################################################################################################################

# Of course, our context manager object is not very robust - there is no exception handling for example.
# But let's leave that "minor detail" aside for now :-)
# We still have to create the generator object from the generator function before we can use the context manager class.
# We can simplify things even more by using a decorator:

print('#' * 52 + '  We still have to create the generator object from the generator function before'
                 '  we can use the context manager class.')
print('#' * 52 + '  We can simplify things even more by using a decorator:')


def context_manager_dec(gen_fn):
    def helper(*args, **kwargs):
        gen = gen_fn(*args, **kwargs)
        ctx = GenContextManager(gen)
        return ctx
    return helper

# Notice what this decorator does.
# It decorates a generator function and returns helper. When we invoke helper it will create an instance
# of the generator, and create and return an instance of the context manager.
# Let's try it out:


@context_manager_dec
def open_file(fname, mode='r'):
    print('opening file...')
    f = open(fname, mode)
    try:
        yield f
    finally:
        print('closing file...')
        f.close()


with open_file('test.txt') as f:
    print(f.r..())
# opening file...
# ['Sir Spamalot']
# calling next to perform cleanup in generator
# closing file...
# ######################################################################################################################


# So now we have an approach to using a decorator to turn any generator function (that has the structure we mentioned
# earlier) into a context manager!
# Our code was not very robust, either in the context manager class or in the decorator - and it would take quite
# a bit more work to make it so.
# Fortunately the standard library has already though of this - in fact that was one of the critical goals of Python's
# context managers - the ability to create context managers using generator functions (see PEP 343).

print('#' * 52 + '  So now we have an approach to using a decorator to turn any generator function'
                 '  (that has the structure we mentioned earlier) into a context manager!')

from contextlib import contextmanager


@contextmanager
def open_file(fname, mode='r'):
    print('opening file...')
    f = open(fname, mode)
    try:
        yield f
    finally:
        print('closing file...')
        f.close()

with open_file('test.txt') as f:
    print(f.r..())
# opening file...
# ['Sir Spamalot']

# And of course, this works for more than just opening and closing files.
# Here are some more examples:
# Example 1
# Let's implement a timer

print('#' * 52 + '  Lets implement a timer.')

from time import perf_counter, sleep


@contextmanager
def timer():
    stats = dict()
    start = perf_counter()
    stats['start'] = start
    try:
        yield stats
    finally:
        end = perf_counter()
        stats['end'] = end
        stats['elapsed'] = end - start


with timer() as stats:
    sleep(1)

print(stats)
# {'start': 5.417897319468211e-07, 'end': 1.005228270913287, 'elapsed': 1.005227729123555}

# Example 2
# In this example, let's redirect stdout.

print('#' * 52 + '  In this example, lets redirect `stdout`.')

import sys


@contextmanager
def out_to_file(fname):
    current_stdout = sys.stdout
    file = open(fname, 'w')
    sys.stdout = file
    try:
        yield None
    finally:
        file.close()
        sys.stdout = current_stdout


with out_to_file('test.txt'):
    print('line 1')
    print('line 2')

with open('test.txt') as f:
    print(f.r..())
# ['line 1\n', 'line 2\n']
# ######################################################################################################################

# And of course, stdout is back to "normal":
print('#' * 52 + '  And of course, `stdout` is back to "normal":')

print('line 1')
# line 1

# The contextlib module actually implements a stdout redirect context manager, so we technically don't
# have to write one ourselves.
# The difference from thge one we wrote is that it needs an open file object, not just a file name.
# So we would have to open the file, then redirect stdout. We can do this easily by nesting two context managers
# as follows:

print('#' * 52 + '  The `contextlib` module actually implements a `stdout` redirect context manager,'
                 '  so we technically dont have to write one ourselves.')

from contextlib import redirect_stdout

with open('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    with redirect_stdout(f):
        print('Look on the bright side of life')

# And we can check that this worked:

with open('test.txt') as f:
    print(f.r..())
# ['Look on the bright side of life\n']
