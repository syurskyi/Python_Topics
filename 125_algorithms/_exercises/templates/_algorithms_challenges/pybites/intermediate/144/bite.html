<p>Some more fun working with dates! In this Bite you will calculate the number of months between the fixed <code>START_DATE = date(2018, 11, 1)</code> and the date you will construct from the input arguments.</p><p>You should raise the proper <code>exception</code>s and perform the proper upper rounding based on the fact that <code>>= 10 days</code> in the <i>datetime difference</i> adds another month to the counter.</p><p>Best to give you some examples of the expected results so check out the docstring and tests, then start coding Python ðŸ’ª. You probably want to use <a href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank"><code>dateutil.relativedelta</code></a> for this one! Good luck!</p>
