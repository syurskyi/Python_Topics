<p>It's the 12th of May 2019 when we write this so happy Mother's Day! In many countries this special day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May. In this Bite you will calculate which date this was / will be for year range 2014-2024.</p> <p>Complete <code>get_mothers_day_date</code> which takes a <code>year int</code> argument and returns a <code>date</code> object = the 2nd Sunday of May for that year. We use <a href="http://www.calendarpedia.com/when-is/mothers-day.html">this table</a> in our tests to verify your code.</p> <p>Good luck and, Mother's day or not, ABC/ Always Be Coding! And of course best if we keep calm and code in Python :)</p>
