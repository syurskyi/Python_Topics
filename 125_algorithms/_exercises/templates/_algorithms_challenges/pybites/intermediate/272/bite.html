<p>Given two sentences that each contains words in case insensitive way, you have to check the common <strong>case insensitive</strong> words appearing in both sentences.</p>

<p>If there are duplicate words in the results, just choose one. The results should be sorted by words length.</p>

<p>The sentences are presented as list of words. Example:<pre>
S = ['You', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'but', 'not', 'everything']
##                  **                       **
T = ['We', 'are', 'what', 'we', 'repeatedly', 'do', 'is', 'not', 'an', 'act']
##                                             **          **
Result = ['do', 'not']
</pre>
</p>
