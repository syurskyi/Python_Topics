<p>In this Bite you are going to capitalize sentences in a block of lowercased text.</p>

<p>Correct grammar dictates that each sentence should start with a capital letter, so complete <code>capitalize_sentences</code> to do just that.</p>

<p>To make this a bit harder we have sentences ending with dot (.), question mark (?) and exclamation mark (!)</p>

<p>Have fun and code more Python!</p>
