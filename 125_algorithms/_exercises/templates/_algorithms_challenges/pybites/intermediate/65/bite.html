<p>This Bite focusses on the use of <code>itertools</code>. To that extend you complete <code>get_possible_dict_words</code> and <code>_get_permutations_draw</code> to get all valid dictionary words for a random draw of 7 letters.</p><p>This is fed into the tests that calculate the word with maximum value (work previously done for <a href="https://codechalleng.es/bites/3/">Bite 3</a>) and there you go: you have a Scrabble cheat tool (Scrabble fans, pay attention or maybe skip this Bite!).</p><p>For example a draw of letters <i>G, A, R, Y, T, E, V</i> would give highest valued word  <i>GARVEY</i> (13 points).</p><p><hr><small><i>This Bite is adapted from PyBites Code Challenge 02: <a href="https://codechalleng.es/challenges/2/">Word Values Part II - A Simple Game</a>. Check it out if you want to code up the complete game including the user interaction part.</small></i></p>
