First idea was to go through the list and build a dictionary holding:
key: word
value: tuple(index, count)

and then make a run through this dictionary and build output list taking out indexes of words with count > 1.

But, I completely forgot that ** TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE **. So I cannot update a tuple after it's created (cannot update counts).

So, quick fix for that was to replace namedtuple with dictionary. 
That worked, but I got puzzled by following construct:

Assuming dictionary like this:

{'is': {'index': 0, 'count': 2}, 'it': {'index': 1, 'count': 2}, 'true': {'index': 2, 'count': 1}, 'or': {'index': 3, 'count': 1}, 'not?': {'index': 6, 'count': 1}}

With following code:

for k, v in stats.values():
   print(k)
   print(v)

I get:

index
count
index
count
index
count
index
count
index
count

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

1. Checking for existence of key in dictionary

mydict = {
    "one": "1",
    "two": "2",
    "three": "3",
    "four": "4",
}

key="one"

if key in mydict:
    print("Key exists") 
else:
    print("Key does not exist")

2. Tuples are immutable

3. It's easy to count particular item in a list:

words = ['is', 'on', 'the', 'way', 'way']

words.count('way')

4. It's easy to check index of a particular item in a list:

words.index('way') 

5. Once again, list comprehensions! But watch out! whether to use {} or []

duplicate_words = {word for word in words if words.count(word) > 1}
result = sorted([words.index(word) for word in duplicate_words]) 

6. dict, defaultdict, ordereddict, get method, exceptions

___ get_duplicate_indices(words):
    """Given a list of words, loop through the words and check for each

       If so return the index of its first occurrence.

       occur more than once, and they are at indices 0 and 1 so you would
