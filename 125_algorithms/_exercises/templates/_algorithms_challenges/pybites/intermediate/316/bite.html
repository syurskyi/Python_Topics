<p>You're on a movie budget so you want to evaluate if streaming movies could be more economical than renting them.</p>
<p>For exercise sake we are going to assume that all movies you rent would be equally available on a single streaming service that has a fixed cost of 12/mo (<code>STREAMING_COST_PER_MONTH</code>, to keep it simple we stick with <code>int</code>s for movie prices in this exercise).</p>
<p>In this Bite you will code the <code>rent_or_stream</code> function:</p>
<p>- It receives <code>renting_history</code> which is a sequence of <code>MovieRented</code> <code>namedtuple</code>s, each one representing a record of a movie rented at a certain date for a certain price.</p>
<p>- Loop through those movies and return a <code>dict</code> of keys = months (format: <code>YYYY-MM</code>), and values = 'rent' or 'stream' based on what is cheaper (= total money spent on renting movies that month being less than the fixed <code>STREAMING_COST_PER_MONTH</code>).</p>
<p>Here is a quick demo how this function should work:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import date<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; from movie_budget import rent_or_stream, MovieRented<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; renting_history = [<br />...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MovieRented('Sonic', 10, date(2020, 11, 4)),<br />...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MovieRented('Die Hard', 3, date(2020, 11, 3))<br />... ]<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; rent_or_stream(renting_history)<br />{'2020-11': 'stream'}&nbsp; # 13 &gt; 12<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; renting_history = [<br />...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MovieRented('Breach', 7, date(2020, 12, 1)),<br />...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MovieRented('Love and Monsters', 5, date(2020, 12, 9))<br />... ]<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; rent_or_stream(renting_history)<br />{'2020-12': 'rent'}&nbsp; # 12 &gt;= 12</pre>
<p>Have fun and keep calm and code in Python üêç</p>
