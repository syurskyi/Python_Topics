<p>You have been given a comma-delimited <strong>.csv</strong> file containing class roster data.</p>
<p>Your task is to re-format this data so it can be imported into your student information system. Only the output counts for this Bite.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each row of the input file contains data for a single student and all of their assigned classes, formatted as follows:</p>
<pre>StudentID,StudentName,Class1,Class2,... (etc.)</pre>
<p>Sample input row:</p>
<pre>34215,"Smith, John",,MATH06-1 - PH,ENG06-1 - BlR,,,PE06-1 - TK</pre>
<p>- StudentID: a 5-digit int</p>
<p>- StudentName: formatted as "Last, First", including quotation marks</p>
<p>- Classes: there may be any number of classes per student on a single row, each formatted as: <em>CLASSNAME-SECTION - TeacherInitials</em></p>

<pre>['MATH06-1,2020,34215', 'ENG06-1,2020,34215', 'PE06-1,2020,34215']</pre>
<h4>Notes:</h4>
<p>- The returned list should hold one entry per student per class assigned, in the same student order as the input file</p>
