DATE: 05 Nov 2020
TASK DESCRIPTION:

Write a function that receives one or more sequences. The sequences are already defined for you.
The function should return a table (list of strings) where the columns are the sequences
(example below).

To keep it simple we work with equally sized sequences so you don't have to worry about
handling a missing value (you should end up with a grid of 6 rows x n columns).
There are some Pythonic idioms you can use here, hint: think of pants ;)

Example call (look at the tests for more detail):

>>> generate_table(names, aliases)
['Julian | Pythonista', 'Bob | Nerd', 'PyBites | Coder',
 'Dante | Pythonista', 'Martin | Nerd', 'Rodolfo | Coder']
Bonus: use a generator to build up the table rows.

import random

names = 'Julian Bob PyBites Dante Martin Rodolfo'.split()
aliases = 'Pythonista Nerd Coder'.split() * 2
points = random.sample(range(81, 101), 6)
awake = [True, False] * 3
SEPARATOR = ' | '


### ----------- My solution ---------------------------

___ my_generate_table(*args):
    l = []
    result = zip(*args)
    for i in result:
        s = ""
        for t in i:
            __ s == "":
                s = str(t)
            else:
                s = s + " | " + str(t)
        l.append(s)
    return l

### ---------- PyBites original solution ---------------

___ pyb_generate_table(*sequences):
    for seq in zip(*sequences):
        seq = [str(val) for val in seq]
        yield SEPARATOR.join(seq)
