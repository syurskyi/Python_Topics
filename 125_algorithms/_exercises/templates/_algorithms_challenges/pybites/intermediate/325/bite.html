<p>This Bite introduces you to a few issues associated with doing floating point arithmetic: the numbers that you 'see on screen', and the arithmetic that you were taught at school, might not correspond with how those numbers are represented internally on your machine.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">These issues often come to the fore when sending and receiving JSON-encoded numbers between systems, having to </span>convert numbers between their string and floating point representations, and performing arithmetic and rounding operations on those numbers.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Given the following JSON-encoded string containing a number of floating point values: </span></p>
<pre><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">"[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.005, 0.005, 2.67]"</span></pre>
<p>...complete function <code>calc_sums</code> that produces a sequence of strings that, when read, will recite the calculation and provide the result of summing each adjacent pair of numbers. For example, the output produced should be:</p>
<pre>The sum of 0.1 and 0.2, rounded to two decimal places, is 0.30.<br />The sum of 0.2 and 0.3, rounded to two decimal places, is 0.50.</pre>
<p>...and so on until all five pairs of numbers have been processed. The summed values should also be rounded to <strong>two</strong> decimal places, with ties rounded up (e.g. <code>0.305</code> is rounded up to <code>0.31</code>).</p>
<p>Have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html?highlight=floating%20point%20issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial</a> in the Python standard documentation for an introduction to floating point arithmetic if<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">&nbsp;you get stuck.</span></p>
<p>Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
