'''
Although you have to be careful using recursion it is one of those concepts you want to at least understand. It's also commonly used in coding interviews :)

In this beginner Bite we let you rewrite a simple countdown for loop using recursion. See countdown_for below, it produces the following output:

$ python countdown.py
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
time is up
You will be tested on having the same output, making it work with another start value, and of course if you used recursion. Have fun!
'''


___ countdown_for(start=10):
    for i in reversed(range(1, start + 1)):
        print(i)
    print('time is up')


___ countdown_recursive(start=10):
    __ start == 0:
        print('time is up')
    else:
        print(start)
        countdown_recursive(start-1)


countdown_recursive(10)
