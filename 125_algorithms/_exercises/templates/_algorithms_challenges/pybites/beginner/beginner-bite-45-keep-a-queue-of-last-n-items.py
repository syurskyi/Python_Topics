How about writing a queue that holds the last 5 items?

Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
A real-world example of queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first.
More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops.

Complete the my_queue function to return a queue-like data type that keeps the last n items.

Check the standard library to see how you can do this in the shortest/most efficient way.

See an example output below and the tests that check for various values of n. Have fun!

_______ c..

___ my_queue(n=5
    d c...d..('', n)
    r.. d

mq my_queue()
___ i __ r..(10
    mq.a..(i)
print((i, l..(mq)))
