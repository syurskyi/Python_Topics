"""
Given an integer number, find the most frequent digit in it.

Examples:

1998 -> two 9's, one 1, one 8 so return 9
177 -> return 7
2020 -> there is 2 two's, 2 zero's. Return 2 = the first highest hitter
12345 -> all digits occur once, so like the last example return the first digit = 1
Food for thought: how to count things efficiently?

Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!
