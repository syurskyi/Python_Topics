Complete the generate_affiliation_link(url) function below which should convert the following links:

https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/?keywords=war+of+art
https://amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1

... into the following affiliation links respectively:
