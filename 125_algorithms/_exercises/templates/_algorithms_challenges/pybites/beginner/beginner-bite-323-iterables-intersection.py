"""
In this bite we are going to work on coding a function intersection() that searches
the common elements across its input. More specifically:

- Input to the function will be one, two or more objects which can be iterated
on (e.g., list, tuple, str)

- The function's output is a set containing the intersection across input iterables,
or an empty set if no common elements are found

Notes:

- Filter out inputs which are None or empty
- If after the filter you end up with just one iterable,
the output is a set with the unique elements in that iterable (see last example below)

Here is how it works in the Python interpreter's Read Execute Print Loop (REPL):

>>> from intersection import intersection
>>> insersection({1,2,3}, {2,3,4}, {3,4})
{3}
>>> intersection([1,2,3,"1"], {1,-1}, {})
{1}
>>> intersection(None, "this is a string")
{' ', 'a', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'n', 'r', 's', 't'}
Note: the template provides a hint to use a standard library module that can help you,
but it is not mandatory for solving this bite (i.e., there are at least two ways
to code intersection())
