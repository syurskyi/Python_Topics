"""
Complete count_dirs_and_files traversing the passed in directory path.

Return a tuple of (number_of_directories, number_of_files)

Let's use the tree command to show an example:

$ mkdir -p project/a/1/I project/a/1/II project/a/2 project/b/1/I
tree project/
project/
├── a
│   ├── 1
│   │   ├── I
│   │   └── II
│   └── 2
└── b
    └── 1
        └── I

8 directories, 0 files
Your solution should match these counts:

$ python
>>> from tree import count_dirs_and_files
>>> count_dirs_and_files('project')
(8, 0)
Let's add two files:

$ touch project/a/1/I/bob
$ touch project/a/2/julian
$ python
>>> from tree import count_dirs_and_files
>>> count_dirs_and_files('project')
(8, 2)
Good luck and have fun!
