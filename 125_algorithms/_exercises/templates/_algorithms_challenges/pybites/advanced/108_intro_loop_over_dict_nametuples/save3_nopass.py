# ___ get_total_points belts_?
#     """Calculate the amount of points rewarded on PyBites given the

#        (of course there are more points but let's keep it simple)
#
#        Make your code generic so if we update ninja_belts to include
#        more belts (which we do in the tests) it will still work.
#
#        Ah and you can get score and ninjas from the namedtuple with nice
#        attribute access: belt.score / belt.ninjas (reason why we get
#        you familiar with namedtuple here, because we love them and use
#        them all over the place!)
