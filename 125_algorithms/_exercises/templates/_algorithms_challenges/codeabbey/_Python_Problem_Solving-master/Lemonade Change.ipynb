    "# Lemonade Change\n",
    "At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: [5,5,5,10,20]\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.\n",
    "From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.\n",
    "From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\n",
    "Since all customers got correct change, we output true.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",

    "Input: [5,5,10]\n",

    "Example 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: [5,5,10,10,20]\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.\n",
    "For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.\n",
    "For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.\n",
    "Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.\n",
