"""
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values
of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9,
8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the
same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2
are leaf-similar.

Note:

Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
