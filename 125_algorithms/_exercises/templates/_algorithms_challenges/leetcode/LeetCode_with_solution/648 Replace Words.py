"""
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other
words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example,
the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to
replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a
successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest
length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:

Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"


Note:

The input will only have lower-case letters.
1 <= dict words number <= 1000
1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
1 <= root length <= 100
1 <= sentence words length <= 1000
