# Triangle

Write a program that can tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

Tests are provided, delete one `skip` at a time.

## Hint

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the
length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle
inequality_.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.


For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).
