Main Concept:

end by '*' and has no matched
case 1-1: `P[j-2:j]` is `c*` and have no matched in `S`
=> `j-2` in `dp[i][j-2]` means ignored `c` and `*`

end by `*` and is the last matched in `*`
case 1-2: `P[j-2:j]` is `.*` and `.` always matched `S[i-1]`
case 1-3: `P[j-2:j]` is `a*` and `a` == `P[j-2]` == `S[i-1]`
=> `i-1` in `dp[i-1][j]` means to check the `?` below
    '...a?a'
         \|
    '...xa*'

case 2: `P[j-1]` is `.` and `.` always matched `S[i-1]`
case 3: `P[j-1]` is `a` and `a` == `P[j-1]` == `S[i-1]`
=> `-1` in `dp[i-1][j-1]` means previous char
