Assuming: len(A) == len(B) == 3

To find the result(min of A[i]+B[j]), we got a 3x3 matrix:
AB | 0 | 1 | 2 |
 0 | a | b | c |
 1 | d | e | f |
 2 | g | h | i |

 1. put the first column (0, j) into heap, these child is the min for each row
 2. get the minest one, and move the `x` pointer forward, put the child at (x+1, y)
 3. keep find the minest one in current heap, then we can find the kth child
