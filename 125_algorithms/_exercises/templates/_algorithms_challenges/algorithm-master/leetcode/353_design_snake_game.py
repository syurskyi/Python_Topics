0. self.height is for `m`, self.width is for `n`
1. note that, REMOVE FIRST,
   MUST remove the snake tail **BEFORE** check it hit its body
2. this game is over if
    - hit wall
    - hit it self
    - no food

3. dont pop food in every move, just track its index
4. the score is just the len(body) - 1, except the head

5. what its return if no food or food is all taken?
6. does allow the snake just back if its body only 2?


Initially the snake appears at position (0,0) and the food at (1,2).
Your SnakeGame object will be instantiated and called as such:
obj = SnakeGame(width, height, food)
param_1 = obj.move(direction)

>>> [snake.move(d) for d in 'RDRULU']
