# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
# Solution:

c_ Solution:
    ___ Fizzbuzz(x,z):
        ___ i __ r..(x,z):
            __ i % 3 __ 0 a.. i % 5 __ 0:
                print ("FizzBuzz")
            ____ i % 3 __ 0:
                print ("Fizz")
            ____ i % 5 __ 0:
                print ("Buzz")
            ____:
                print (i)
