# # Single Number
# # Question: Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
# # Note:
# # Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
# # Solutions:
#
#
# c_ Solution
#     # @param A, a list of integer
#     # @return an integer
#     ___ singleNumber  A
#         result _ 0
#         ___ i __ ?
#             ? ^_ ?
#         r_ ?
#
#
# ? .? [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]
