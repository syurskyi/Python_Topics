# # Count and Say
# # Question: The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
# # 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
# # 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
# # 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
# # 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
# # Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
# # Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
# # Solutions:
