# # Sort Colours
# # Question: Given an array with n objects coloured red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same colour are adjacent, with the colours in the order red, white and blue.
# # Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the colour red, white, and blue respectively.
# # Note: You are not supposed to use the library's sort function for this problem
# # Solutions:

# c_ Solution
#     # @param A a list of integers
#     # @return sorted A, sort in place
#     ___ sortColors  A
#         color_ 0 * 3
#         ___ i __ ?
#             ? ? +_ 1
#         i _ 0
#         ___ x __ ra.. 3
#             ___ j __ ra.. ? ?
#                 ? ? _ x
#                 ? +_ 1
#         r_ ?
