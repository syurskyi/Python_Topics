# # Write a Python program to sort a list of elements using the bubble sort algorithm.
# # Note : According to Wikipedia "Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that
# # repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the
# # wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
# # The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
# # Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort.
# # It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly
# # in position.
