# # Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
# # Note :
# # An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
# # A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
# # An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.
#
# print("Input lengths of the triangle sides: "
# x _ in. i.. "x: "
# y _ in. i.. "y: "
# z _ in. i.. "z: "
#
# __ x __ y __ z
# 	print("Equilateral triangle")
# ____ x !_ y !_ z:
# 	print("Scalene triangle")
# ____
# 	print("isosceles triangle")
