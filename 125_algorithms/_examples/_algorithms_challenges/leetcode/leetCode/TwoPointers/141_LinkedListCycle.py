    Two pointers: one go 1 step, another one go 2 steps every time.
    Then if the list has a cycle, fast one will meet the slow one absolutely.
    Prove as follows:
    1. If has a circle
        Assume there are m nodes that not in cycle, and then k nodes in cycle.
        And slow one now go m+i nodes, fast one go 2m + 2i nodes whitout doubt.
        So, slow one in the i's node of the circle, and fast one m+2i
        That's say, fast one goes m+i steps more than slow one.
        As the nodes keep going,
        i grows so (m+i) mode k == 0, then fast and slow meet here.
    2. If not:
        fast one will meet None node.
