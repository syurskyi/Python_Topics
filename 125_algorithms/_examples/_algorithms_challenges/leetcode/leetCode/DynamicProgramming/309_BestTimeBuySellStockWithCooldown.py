    A very good explanation come with thinking process is here:

    States definition:
        buy[i]: The maxProfit for any sequence end with buy in pre i days.
        sell[i]: The maxProfit for any sequence end with sell in pre i days.
    Transition function (price is the price of day i):
        buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-2] - price)
        sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1] + price)
    To get buy[i](sell[i] is the same), there are two possibilities:
        1. No transaction on day i, then buy[i] = buy[i-1]
        2. Buy stock on day i, last sell must berofe i-1 day,
           then buy[i] = sell[i-2] - price
