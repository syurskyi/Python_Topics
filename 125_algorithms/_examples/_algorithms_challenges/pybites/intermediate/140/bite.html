<p>This is a <em>Pandas</em> proof-of-concept Bite. We just added the library to our platform!</p>
<p>For this Bite you find out the male and female athletes who won most medals in all the Summer Olympic Games (<a href="https://bites-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/summer.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">csv = 1896-2012</a>, but we also test a smaller subset of the data).</p>
<p>Expect more Pandas Bites to start appearing on our platform ...</p>
