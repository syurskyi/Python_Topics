<p>In this Bite you make a generator of rhombus shapes. You will complete <code>gen_rhombus</code> that when called like this:<pre>
  gen = gen_rhombus(5)  # gen_rhombus is a generator
  for row in gen:
      print(row)
</pre><br>... will generate the following output:<pre>
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
</pre></p><p>When called with a greater width (you only have to worry about uneven widths for this exercise):<pre>
  gen = gen_rhombus(11)
  for row in gen:
      print(row)
</pre><br>... the output would be:<pre>
     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
 *********
***********
 *********
  *******
   *****
    ***
     *
</pre>So the middle row is always equal to the <code>width</code> passed in. Checkout how <code>format</code> or <code>f-strings</code> can help you here, as well as the <code>range</code> builtin. Have fun!</p>
