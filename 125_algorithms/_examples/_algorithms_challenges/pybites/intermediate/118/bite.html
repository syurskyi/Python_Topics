<p>In this Bite you are presented with a list of words. Loop through them and find all the words that are duplicated. Of those return the (0-based) indices of the first occurrence.</p>
<p>Example: <code>['this', 'is', 'a', 'new', 'bite', 'I', 'hope', 'this', 'bite', 'will', 'teach', 'you', 'something', 'new']</code> would return <code>[0, 3, 4]</code>, because <em>this</em>, <em>new</em>, and <em>bite</em> are duplicated and are at index 0, 3 and 4 respectively.</p>
