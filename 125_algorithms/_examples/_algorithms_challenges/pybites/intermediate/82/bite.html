<p>Starting Python 3.4 there is support for enumerations (not to confuse with the <code>enumerate</code> builtin). You can define a class that inherits from <code>Enum</code>.</p><p>In this Bite we have some constants that are related: the scores we provide for our Bites depending the level and if cheated. As these variables relate they are an ideal candidate to be refactored into an <code>Enum</code>. But that would not be much of a Bite, right? So we added two requirements: <ol><li>Add a <code>__str__</code> method so each member would print like this: <code>BEGINNER => 👍👍</code>, where BEGINNER is the level and  the number of thumbs ups the amount of points.</li><li>Write a <code>classmethod</code> called <code>average</code> that returns an average of the scores in the <code>Enum</code>.</p><p>See the TESTS tab for more info. You might want to read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" target="_blank">the Enum docs</a> to see how you can pull this off. We hope it clicks and you find joy coding this one, and of course that you earn your full 👍👍👍 for this INTERMEDIATE Bite. Good luck and have fun!</p>
