<p>In this Bite you will parse an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SRT</a> (SubRip Subtitle file / video captions or subtitles).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a snippet that shows how such a file is formatted:</p>
<pre>...<br />5<br />00:00:18,080 --&gt; 00:00:22,180<br />Because if you're really new to Python, we really recommend to start with the Newbies,<br /><br />6<br />00:00:22,180 --&gt; 00:00:26,260<br />and otherwise gauge your level doing the 10 Introductory Bites.<br />...</pre>
<p>Each block is separated by two newlines and consists of:<br />- a section number,<br />- a start and an end time, separated by <code>--&gt;</code>,<br />- the actual caption or subtitle text.<br /><br />Calculate the differences between start and end times for each section, returning a list of section ids ordered by the fastest speech (= most chars spoken per second).<br /><br />Here is an example how the code should work:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; text = """<br />... 1<br />... 00:00:00,498 --&gt; 00:00:02,827<br />... Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />...<br />... 2<br />... 00:00:02,827 --&gt; 00:00:06,383<br />... Explicit is better than implicit.<br />...<br />... 3<br />... 00:00:06,383 --&gt; 00:00:09,427<br />... Simple is better than complex.<br />... """<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; from srt import get_srt_section_ids<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; get_srt_section_ids(text)<br />[1, 3, 2]</pre>
