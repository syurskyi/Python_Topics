"""
Write a function to determine if a word (or phrase) is a palindrome.

Then write a second function to receive a word (or phrase) list and determine which word is the
longest palindrome.

See the template code / docstrings below for further requirements as well as the tests.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters
which reads the same backward as forward.
