<p>In this Bite you compare a list of packages (aka <i>requirement.txt</i>) from before vs. after (pip) upgrade. Check the <i>TESTS</i> tab for the format of the input data.</p><p>Complete the <code>changed_dependencies</code> function that receives the old and new requiements (multiline) <code>str</code>s and returns a <code>list</code> of package names that were upgraded (new version > previous version).</p><p>To keep it manageable you can assume that both requirement <code>str</code>s have the same packages, no packages were added or deleted.</p><p>A note about the digits (major/minor) numbers in the packages: they are <code>int</code>s, so <code>twilio==6.23.1</code> > <code>twilio==6.3.0</code> (see also <a href="https://pypi.org/project/twilio/#history" target="_blank">Twilio's history log</a>).</p><p>Have fun and we hope you learn a thing or two! (hint: Python's standard library is your friend!)</p>
