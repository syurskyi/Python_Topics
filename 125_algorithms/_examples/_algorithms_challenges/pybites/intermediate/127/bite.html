<p>In this Bite you complete a function that takes an <code>int</code> and returns it appended with the right suffix: 1 -> 1st, 2 -> 2nd, 4 -> 4th, 11 -> 11th, etc.</p><p>As per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator#Other_suffixes" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> the rules are: <ul><li>-st is used with numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 1st, pronounced first)</li><li>-nd is used with numbers ending in 2 (e.g. 92nd, pronounced ninety-second)</li><li>-rd is used with numbers ending in 3 (e.g. 33rd, pronounced thirty-third). As an exception to the above rules, all the "teen" numbers ending with 11, 12 or 13 use -th (e.g. 11th, pronounced eleventh, 112th, pronounced one hundred [and] twelfth)</li><li>-th is used for all other numbers (e.g. 9th, pronounced ninth).</li></ul><p>To focus on the exercise you can assume that the number inputted into the function is a positive <code>int</code>. Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
