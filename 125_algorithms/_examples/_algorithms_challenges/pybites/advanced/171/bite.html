<p>In this Bite you will spice up your command line apps with a loader animation.</p><p>You will use <code>itertools.cycle</code> and <code>sys.stdout</code> to make the following terminal spinner animation: </p><p><br><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bites-data/spinner.gif" alt="our fancy spinner animation in action" class="flex"></p><p>Apart from the module imports we already defined <code>SPINNER_STATES</code> and <code>STATE_TRANSITION_TIME</code> = the amount of time to pause between states. Hopefully this will make it a bit easier.</p><p>One last hint is to look at how to <i>flush</i> terminal output so states you print to stdout don't get concatenated.</p><p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
