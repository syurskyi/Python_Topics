<p>In this Bite you are going to write a 15-way Rock Paper Scissors game (this challenge first appeared as part of our <a href="https://talkpython.fm/100days" target="_blank">100 Days of Code in Python course</a>).</p><img class="flex" src="http://www.umop.com/images/rps15.jpg" alt="picture of who beats who in this 15-way version of rock paper scissors"><p><br>(source: <a href="http://www.umop.com/rps15.htm" target="_blank">http://www.umop.com/rps15.htm</a>)<br></p><p>The way you read this graphic is if an arrow points from one item to another, that pointed-to item is defeated. For example:<ul> <li>Paper defeats rock (paper points to rock)</li> <li>Devil defeats human (devil points to human)</li></ul></p> <p>It turns out to be error prone and generally very unfun to work this out from the graphic. So we created a <code>csv</code> score sheet representing these relationships.</p> <p>Complete the <code>get_winner</code> function following the docstring. We recommend parsing it into a dictionary/mapping of <i>players -> beats whom</i> (key, value) pairs (helper function <code>_create_defeat_mapping</code>). This will make it easier to determine the winner given any pair of (player1, player2) pairs.</p> <p>The tests (see <i>TESTS</i> tab) will verify valid input to <code>get_winner</code>, all <i>Tie</i> scenarios and (more interestingly) all 105 outcomes using the original <i><a href="http://www.umop.com/rps15.htm" target="_blank">RPS-15 speak</a></i>.</p> <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
