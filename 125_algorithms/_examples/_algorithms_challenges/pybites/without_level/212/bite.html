<p>Ever wanted to suppress an exception? Check out Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html" target="_blank"><code>contextlib</code></a> module.</p>

<p>In this Bite you refactor <code>sum_numbers</code> which has some nested try/except statements. Use <code>suppress</code> to make this logic cleaner/ more readable. Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
