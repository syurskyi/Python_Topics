INSTRUCTIONS = """\n | Welcome to our version of the Blackjack Game |
=================================================================================
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. 
Each card has a value and a suit. The values are added for the final result.

The game starts by dealing two cards to the player (you) and to the dealer.            
You are playing against the dealer. On each turn, you must choose if you
would like to take another card or stand to stop the game and see if you won.

The game ends if the total value of the player's hand goes over 21,
and if the total value of the hand is below 21, the game continues
until the player chooses to stand.

When the game ends or when the player chooses to stand,
the total value of each hand is calculated.  
The value that is closest to 21 without going over it wins the game.
If the total value is over 21, the player or dealer automatically lose the game.
