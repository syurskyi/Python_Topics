# Type-based selections can always be coded using the type-testing ideas we met in
# Chapters 4 and 9, or the argument list tools introduced in Chapter 18:

class C:

            pass
        elif type(args[0]) == int:

# your code to expect an object interface, not a specific data type. That way, it will be
# useful for a broader category of types and applications, both now and in the future:

class C:
