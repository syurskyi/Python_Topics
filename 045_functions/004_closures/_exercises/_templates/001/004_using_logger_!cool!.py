# When and why to use Closures:
#
#     As closures are used as callback functions, they provide some sort of data hiding. T
#     his helps us to reduce the use of global variables.
#     When we have few functions in our code, closures prove to be efficient way.
#     But if we need to have many functions, then go for class (OOP).
