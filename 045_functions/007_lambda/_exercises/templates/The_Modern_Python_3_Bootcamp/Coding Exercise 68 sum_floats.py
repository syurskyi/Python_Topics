# # Sum Floats Solution
# #
# # Write a function called sum_floats. This function should accept a variable number of arguments.
# # The function should return the sum of all the parameters that are floats.
# # If there are no floats the function should return 0
# #
# #     I started by defining sum_floats , which accepts any number of arguments using *args
# #     Much like the previous exercise,
# #     I use a generator expression to extract the values in args where type()  is float.
# #     I pass those values in to sum  and return the result
#
#
# ___ sum_floats $
#     r_ su_ arg ___ ? __ args __ ty.. ? __ fl..
