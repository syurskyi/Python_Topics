# To generate the following using a nested list comprehension:
import pprint
[
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
]

# My solution looks like this:

answer = [[i for i in range(0, 10)] for num in range(0, 10)]
