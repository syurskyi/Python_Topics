# # Using Set and Dictionary Comprehensions
# # While the list comprehension in Python is a common tool, you can also create set and dictionary comprehensions.
# # A set comprehension is almost exactly the same as a list comprehension in Python. The difference is that
# # set comprehensions make sure the output contains no duplicates. You can create a set comprehension by
# # using curly braces instead of brackets:
# #
# quote _ "life, uh, finds a way"
# unique_vowels _ i ___ ? __ ? __ ? __ 'aeiou'
# print ?
# # {'a', 'e', 'u', 'i'}
#
# # Your set comprehension outputs all the unique vowels it found in quote. Unlike lists, sets donâ€™t guarantee that items
# # will be saved in any particular order. This is why the first member of the set is a, even though the first vowel
# # in quote is i.
# # Dictionary comprehensions are similar, with the additional requirement of defining a key:
#
# squares _ i i * i ___ ? __ ra.. 10
# print ?
# # {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}
#
# # To create the squares dictionary, you use curly braces ({}) as well as a key-value pair (i: i * i) in your expression.
