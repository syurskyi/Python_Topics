# Sending Exceptions to Generators

# Suppose we have a coroutine that handles writing data to a database. We have seen in some previous examples where
# we could use a coroutine to start and either commit or abort a transaction - based on closing the generator or
# forcing an exception to happen in the body of the generator.
#
# Let's revisit this example, but now we'll want to use exceptions to indicate to our generator whether to commit or
# abort a transaction, without necessarily exiting the generator:

class CommitException(Exception):
    pass

class RollbackException(Exception):
    pass

def write_to_db():
    print('opening database connection...')
    print('start transaction...')
    try:
        while True:
            try:
                data = yield
                print('writing data to database...', data)
            except CommitException:
                print('committing transaction...')
                print('opening next transaction...')
            except RollbackException:
                print('aborting transaction...')
                print('opening next transaction...')
    finally:
        print('generator closing...')

# throw() and close()

# The close() method does essentially the same thing as throw(GeneratorExit) except that when that exception is thrown
# using throw(), Python does not silence the exception for the caller:

def gen():

        while True:
            received = yield
            print(received)

g.send('hello')
g.close()

g = gen()
next(g)
g.send('hello')
g.throw(GeneratorExit)

# Sending Exceptions to Generators
# throw() and close()
# Even if we catch the exception, we are still exiting the generator, so using throw will result in the caller
# receiving a StopIteration exception.
#
# So, we can use throw to close the generator, but as the caller we now have to handle the exception that
# propagates up to us:

def gen():
    try:
        while True:
            received = yield
            print(received)
    except GeneratorExit:
        print('received generator exit...')
    finally:
        print('closing down...')

g = gen()
next(g)
g.close()

g = gen()
next(g)
g.throw(GeneratorExit)

g = gen()

except StopIteration:
    print('silencing GeneratorExit...')
