# Yielding and Generators
# So now let's see how we could re-write our initial factorial example:

import math

def factorials(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield math.factorial(i)

for num in factorials(5):
    print(num)

facts = factorials(5)

list(facts)
# next(facts) # error

# Making an Iterable from a Generator
# As we now know, generators are iterators.
# This means that they become exhausted - so sometimes we want to create an iterable instead.
# But, sq was an iterator - so now it's been exhausted:
# To restart the iteration we have to create a new instance of the generator (iterator):

def squares_gen(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i ** 2

sq = squares_gen(5)

for num in sq:
    print(num)

next(sq)

sq = squares_gen(5)
[num for num in sq]

# Generators used with other Generators
# Now enumerate is lazy, so sq had not, at this point, been consumed:
# Since we have consumed two elements from sq, when we now use enumerate it will have two less elements from sq:

def squares(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i ** 2

sq = squares(5)
enum_sq = enumerate(sq)

next(sq)
next(sq)

next(enum_sq)

# Generator Expressions
# Recall how list comprehensions worked:
# We can easily create a generator by using () parentheses instead of the [] brackets:
# Note that g is a generator, and is also lazily evaluated:

l = [i ** 2 for i in range(5)]
l
# The expression inside the [] brackets is called a comprehension expression.

g = (i ** 2 for i in range(5))

type(g)

for item in g:
    print(item)

# Generator Expressions
#
# We can iterate over the same list comprehension multiple times, since it is an iterable.
# However, we can only iterate over a comprehension expression once, since it is an iterator.

l = [i * 2 for i in range(5)]
type(l)

g = (i ** 2 for i in range(5))
type(g)
