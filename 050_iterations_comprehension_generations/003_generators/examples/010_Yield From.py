# Yield From
# Suppose we want an iterator to iterate over all the values of the matrix, element by element.
# All we have done here is create a generator (iterator) that can be used to iterate of the elements
# of a nested iterator.

    for row in matrix(n):
        for item in row:
            yield item

# Yield From
# But we can avoid using that nested for loop by using a special form of yield: yield from

# we need to read car brands from multiple files to get it as a single collection.

# we are going to create generators that can read each line of the file, and yield a clean result,
# and we'll yield from that generator:
# As you can see, this generator function will clean each line of the file before yielding it.
# Let's try it with a single file and make sure it works:
# So now, we can proceed with our overarching generator function as before, except we'll yield from our generators,
# instead of directly from the file iterator:
# I want to point out that in this particular instance, we are using yield from as a simple replacement for a for loop
