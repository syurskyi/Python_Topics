# The concrete path classes include a resolve() method for normalizing a path by looking at the filesystem for directories and symbolic links and producing the absolute path referred to by a name.

# Here the relative path is converted to the absolute path to /usr/share. If the input path includes symlinks, those are expanded as well to allow the resolved path to refer directly to the target.
